Slam poet Vanessa Reyes, known for her sarcastic parodies of slam poetry, is known for the following poems.

When You See Me
When you see me, you notice my body, the way my hips curve under my dress, but that is not all I am. I am also a terrible beekeeper. When you see me, you look straight at my chest, you notice my lips, but that is not all I am. I also own thousands of bees and keep them in a jeep grand cherokee that I call the Beep Grand Cherokeeper, and never go inside of, because I am afraid of all the, bees. When you see me, you think about who I’ve touched and who I’ve kissed, not about how many times I’ve been to the hospital for trying to extract honey from the Jeep by rolling down the window and using a hockey stick to scrape the honeycomb only to be stung by literally hundreds of bees. when you see me, you don’t see me at all because to you I’m just another woman who probably hasn’t received multiple injunctions from the city about the illegal beekeeping situation in my Jeep that has caused a massive infestation to spread throughout my cul-de-sac, even though the opposite is true and I am due in court on Monday for this very reason. So the next time you see me, take a good long look because I am more than what you see when you look at me. I am the world’s worst beekeeper, and I am, probably, going, to jail.

When You Hear Me


When you hear me, you think that I am speaking from some great wisdom, some great depth, but the truth is I just read a lot of books and I like the sound of my own voice. When you hear me, you think that I am saying things that are important, that are worth listening to, but the truth is I just like to hear myself talk. When you hear me, you think that I have something to say, but the truth is I just like the sound of my own voice.



I used to think that my Daddy was the bee’s knees
But it turns out that he’s just a horrible beekeeper
He’s always getting stung and covered in honey

And even though I love him, I can’t help but laugh

Every time I see him covered in bees


"The Road Less Travelled"

I’ve taken the road less traveled
But it wasn’t by choice
I got lost in the wilderness
For days, weeks, months, years
I starved, I froze, I suffered
I was so sure I was going to die
But I kept going, kept fighting
Because I knew there was something more
Out there waiting for me
And finally, finally, I made it
To the other side
Only to find that
It was exactly the same
As the place I’d started


"Leaves of Grass"

I am the leaves of grass,

I am the GREEN of grass,

I am the chlorophyll of grass,

I am the DEW on the grass,

I am the BLADES of grass,

I am the ROOTS of grass,

I am the LAWN of grass,

I am the GRASS of grass,

I am the LOVE of grass,

I am thePOISONof grass,

I am the LIFE of grass,

I am the death of grass,

I am the beauty of grass,

I am the beast of grass,

I am the truth of grass,

I am the lie of grass,

I am the justice of grass,

I am the crime of grass,

I am the beginning of grass,

I am the end of grass,

I am the hope of grass,

I am the despair of grass,

I am the future of grass,

I am the past of grass,

I am the present of grass,

I am the grass.



Look at me, standing here in front of you
poetry spilling out of my mouth
like leaves from a tree

I am nature incarnate
I am the epitome of art
I am everything you could ever want

And yet, all you see is a girl
 Standing in a park
 spouting words like they mean something

But they don't, not really
 they're just leaves
 falling from my mouth
 like the leaves that fall from the tree

And you'll never see me as anything more
 because to you, I'm just another girl
 reciting meaningless words
 that will eventually turn to dust



The leaves of grass, they whisper in the dusk,

And the breeze that sways them has a mournful hush;

The flowers have closed their weary eyes,

And all around the tranquil scene lies hushed.

The clouds are hanging low and heavy o'er,

And the stars come out, but dim and few;

The night-bird calls from some far-off tree,

And all the world is sad and drear.



I am the leaves of grass

I am the twilight sky

I am the soft breeze that caresses your face

I am all of these things

But I am also the thing that makes you itch

I am the pollen that gets in your nose

I am the reason you have hay fever

I am the thing that makes you sneeze

I am the bane of your existence

But I am also the thing that makes you feel alive

I am the thing that makes you feel 

The thing that makes you feel like you're a part of something bigger

I am the leaves of grass

And I am the thing that makes you itch



Marty Gave me Chlamydia (Reprise)

I wish I could say I was surprised

When I found out Marty gave me Chlamydia

But I really wasn't all that shocked

I should have known better than to hook up with a guy

Who only ever talks about himself

And has \"I'm a player\" written all over his face

I should have known that someone like Marty

Would only ever think about himself

And would never use a condom

But I was drunk and I was horny

And I wanted to feel someone inside of me

So I ignored all the warning signs

And now I'm paying the price

I'm taking antibiotics and I'm feeling awful

And I have to tell all my partners

That they need to get tested too

I wish I could say I was surprised

But I really wasn't

I should have known better than to hook up with Marty

But I was drunk and I was horny

And now I'm paying the price


I was told to be careful, not to get too close to the sun, but I was young and naive and I thought I knew better. I was a girlboss, and I was going to take the world by storm. I was going to show everyone that I could do it, that I could be successful. And so I reached for the sun, and I got burned. I was too close to the sun, and I got burned. I was young and naive and I thought I knew better, but I was wrong. I was wrong.


I built my empire out of spite,
because I was sick of hearing “you can’t”
I’ve been girlbossing too close to the sun,
and I’m not the only one

My all-nighters are starting to show,
and my skin is looking oh-so-sallow
I’ve been girlbossing too close to the sun,
but I’ll be damned if I stop now

I’m riding this wave until it breaks,
and then I’ll start all over again
I’ve been girlbossing too close to the sun,
but I’m not ready to come down just yet



I was born to be a boss
Bred to be a boss
All the girls in my family are bossy
And I'm the bossiest

So it was only natural that I become a girlboss
Starting my own business
My own empire

But then I got too close to the sun
Got a little too big for my britches
And I crashed and burned

But I got back up
Dusted myself off
And now I'm girlbossing again

This time I'm going to make it
I'm going to be the boss of the world

Watch out, boys
I'm coming for you



I was out on the town,
All dressed up in my best,
When I saw a fair maiden,
And I just couldn't resist.

I approached her boldly,
My heart beating fast,
And I asked her for a dance,
Before I knew what I'd done.

We laughed and we danced,
The night flew by so fast,
And I knew that I was doomed,
When I fell in love at last



A wench on the town, 
All dolled up in red, 
So proud of her assets 
She's bound to turn some heads. 

Aye, she's a buxom lass 
And she knows just what to do 
To make all the men stare 
And wish they were with her, too. 

She saunters down the street 
With a hip-sway and a smile, 
And all the men she passes 
Wish they could stay a while. 

But alas, they must move on 
And leave the wench behind, 
For she's just a fantasy 
And they'll never make her theirs.



A lady I know went to London on a spree,
And she ate at a restaurant called the Ritz.
She started with soup and she ended with tea,
And she ate everything in between.

The moral of this story is quite clear:
You can't trust a wench who is always on the go,
For she's bound to end up at the Ritz,
And she's bound to eat everything in between!

"A Wench and a Lass"


A wench and a lass,
Sitting in a class,
Thinking of a way
To get out of this place.

The teacher's a fool,
The students are, too,
And the whole place is one big bore.

But the wench and the lass
Have a plan to get free,
And they're laughing their heads off
At the thought of it, see!



A Surly Wench was I,
MEAN and NASTY was my Cry,



Andrea, Andrea,   
You're such a splendid lass,
I'd marry you today
If I only had the cash.


Brigham Young was a Bottom


Brigham Young was a bottom

And Joseph Smith was his top

Together they founded a religion

That was based on love and trust

But then Brigham started to bottom out

And Joseph's polygamy came to light

The Church began to crumble

And Brigham's behind was tight

But even in the midst of scandal

The members still loved Brigham's buns

And they continued to follow him

To the end of his days in the sun

Oft have I romet in my metinge-tyme,
And sat by Joseph as he worked al nyght;
I have waschen and to-knead his whit flesch
With myn owen hondes, and of his swete breeth
I have had ful greet deyntee.

Oft have I roamed in my meeting-time,
And sat by Joseph as he worked all night;
I have washed and kneaded his white flesh
With my own hands, and of his sweet breath
I have had great delight.





Boys with their buns,

So soft and round,

I can't help but want to

Squeeze them and feel the firmness

Beneath my fingers.

I long to nibble on them,

To feel their warmth

Against my lips.

I can imagine nothing sweeter

Than sinking my teeth

Into those delicious buns.



Brigham's buns are yeasty and sweet,
But not for queers they were meant;
So if you're one of that ilk,
You'd best not take a bite,
Or Brigham's buns will be your end.



A touch of Tucci,
A touch of class,
A touch of style,
A touch of sass.

A touch of Tucci
Makes any outfit complete,
With a touch of Tucci
You can't go wrong, you'll always look chic!
