\n\"What are you?\"\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\"What's your background?\"\n\nI get asked these questions a lot\nAs if my skin color is some sort of Rorschach test\nAnd people are just dying to know\nWhat they think they see\n\nI'm a walking melting pot\nA human chai latte\nWith a shot of espresso\n\nI'm from the streets of New York\nThe projects of Chicago\nThe barrios of Los Angeles\n\nMy background is black\nWhite\nLatino\nAsian\nNative American\n\nI'm a mix of everything\nAnd I'm proud of it\n\nBut sometimes I just wish people would see me\nFor who I am\nAnd not what they think I am
