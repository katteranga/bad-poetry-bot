\nI'm not really black\nOr really white \nI'm beige\nA boring, off-white\nThat no one really wants to talk about\n\nBut I'm not boring\nI'm exotic\nI'm a mix of the best of both worlds\n\nAnd yes, I know that I'm pretty\nBut don't worry, I'm not conceited\nI'm just confident\n\nAnd I'm not really mixed\nI'm just a little bit off-center\nBut that's what makes me unique\n\nSo if you're ever feeling down\nJust remember, you're not alone\nWe're all a little mixed up\nBut that's what makes us beautiful
