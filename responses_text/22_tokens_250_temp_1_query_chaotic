\nI'm light-skinnedned so they always assume I'm mixed with white \nBut really I'm just Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Black \nThey ask me what my \"real\" hair looks like \nThey say things like, \"You're so exotic!\" or \"You're so pretty for a black girl\" \n\nI'm just black \nI'm just me \nI'm not your cookie cutter idea of what black women should look like \n\nI'm black and I'm proud \nBut that doesn't mean that I have to fit into your tiny little box \nI'm black and I'm beautiful \nAnd I'm exactly who I'm supposed to be
