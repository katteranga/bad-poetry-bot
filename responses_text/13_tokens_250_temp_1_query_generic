\nI'm not sure what you mean when you say \"I'm mixed\" \n\nI'm a commixture of black and white? \nI'm a mongrel like a pit bull? \nI'm a mutt like a labradoodle? \n\nI'm a human being, not a science experiment \nI'm a person, not a handful of Skittles \n\nI'm more than just \"a little bit of this, \na little bit of that\" \n\nI'm a whole lot of everything \nand I'm proud of it
