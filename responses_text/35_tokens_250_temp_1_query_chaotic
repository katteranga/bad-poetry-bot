\nI'm not white\nI'm not black\nI'm light brown and that's just a fact\n\nMy mom is white and my dad is black \nSo what does that make me? \nA little bit of both or stuck in the middle? \n\nPeople always ask me where I'm from \nAnd I never know what to say \nDo I claim my mom's side or my dad's side? \nOr do I just say \"both\"? \n\nIt's hard being mixed race because you're never really sure where you belong \n\nYou're always an outsider looking in, no matter what color your skin is
