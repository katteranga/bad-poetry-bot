\n\"So what are you, anyways?\" \n\nHere we go again,\nI think to myself,\nas I brace myself\nfor the awkward conversation\nthat is to come.\n\n\"I'm mixed\", I reply,\nhalfheartedly,\nknowing full well\nthat they will not accept my answer.\n\n\"No, but what ARE you?\", they press,\ninsistent on putting me in a box,\na neat little label\nfor them to understand me.\n\n\"I'm black and white\", I say,\nknowing that it will never be enough,\nknowing that they will never see me\nas anything other than mixed.
