 I am a product of white supremacy and black violence  I am the walking confirmation of your deepest fears  I am what you never thought possible  I am a brown girl with blue eyes  I am the one thing you can't ignore  I am everything you've been taught to hate  But I am also everything you love  I am everything you are afraid of  But I am also everything you desire  I am the walking contradiction  I am everything you never thought possible  And I am everything you never knew you always wanted  2022-07-26: Who am I? I am half black and half white I am a walking contradiction I am what you never thought possible I have blue eyes and brown skin I am half sisters with Beyonce I have a black daddy and a white mommy I grew up in the hood but I went to private school I am a walking example of what can happen when you mix races I am the one thing you can't ignore I am everything you've been taught to hate But I am also everything you love I am everything you are afraid of But I am also everything you desire I am the walking contradiction I am everything you never thought possible And I am everything you never knew you always wanted
