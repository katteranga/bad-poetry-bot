\n\"What are you, mixed girl?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that\"\n\n*crowd goes \"awwwww\"*\n\nI am the product of a white woman and a black man \nAnd I am so much more than just that \n\nI am a warrior \nI am a queen \nI am a force to be reckoned with \n\nSo don't you dare try to label me \nWith your preconceived notions \nI am mixed and I am proud \nAnd I will not be defined by your limited understanding of race
