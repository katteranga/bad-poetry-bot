 We're all just children of the diaspora Trying to find our way back home Struggle bus, first class all the way to Ghana I googled it, it's not that far But the journey is long and the path is filled with pain But we'll get there  one day  My hair is my map, my afro is my guide I'll find you, my lost kin I'll find you, my sista I'll find you, my bruda I'll find you, my mama
