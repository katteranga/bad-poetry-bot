\n\"What are you mixed with?\"\n\"Where are you really from?\"\n\nIs what they always say\n\nBut I'm from here\nI'm from mixed\nI'm from the in-between\n\nI'm from the color of caramel\nI'm from the curled hair\nI'm from the wide nose\n\nI'm from the best of both worlds\nI'm from the Discrimination Olympics\nI'm from the \"you're not black enough\"\n\nAnd I'm tired of proving myself\nI'm tired of justifying my existence\nI'm tired of being mixed\n\nBut I'm still here\nI'm still standing\nI'm still mixed\n\nAnd I'm proud of it
