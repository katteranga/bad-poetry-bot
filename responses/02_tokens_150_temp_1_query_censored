 \"Mommy,  black or white?\" \"What do you mean, baby?  You're black and white,   just like your father and I.\" \"No, I mean which one should I identify as?  Black or white?\" \"Why does it matter, baby?\" \"Because I'm tired of feeling like I'm not black enough or white enough.  I'm just...tired.\" \"I understand, baby.  But you don't have to choose.  You can be both.  You can be anything you want to be.  \" \"Thank you, mommy.  I love you.\" \"I love you too, baby.\"
