# Bad Poetry Bot

This repository uses OpenAI's GPT-3 Natural Language Algorithm to generate poetry based on supplied examples. In this case, the algorithm is asked to produce poetry similar to [@mr.mosebys_lefttit](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/mrmosebys_lefttit?lang=en)'s parody mixed-race slam poetry. 

This algorithm was supposed to generate awful poetry to make me laugh. While most of the results were medocreâ€”not bad enough to be funny but also not good enough to be goodâ€”there were some amazing results. My favorite bad poems are listed on this sheet under [Highlights](#highlights), and the poems I unironically like are listed under [Actually Kind of Good](#actually-kind-of-good)

The repo is organized into:
* [queries/](./queries/) contains snippets of the requests sent to OpenAI
* [sources/](./sources/) contains transcriptions of @mr.mosebys_lefttit TikTok posts
* [responses_text/](./responses_text/) contains the text responses to the queries
* [responses_screenshots](./responses_screenshots/) contains screenshots of the Postman output for some queries


## Highlights


### Exhibit A (#3)
Suh-weet 
Love like this only comes around once in a blue moon 
But I'm not a lunar cycle kind of queen  
I'm more of a...every 4 years type 

My DNA is a combination of many cultures 
I'm the first one of my kind 
And I'll probably be the last 

One day they'll study me in a high school textbook 
And they'll call me "EXHIBIT A" 
The product of a "mixed" relationship

### Diaspora (#4)

We're all just children of the diaspora
Trying to find our way back home
Struggle bus, first class all the way to Ghana 
I googled it, it's not that far

But the journey is long and the path is filled with pain
But we'll get there  one day
My hair is my map, my afro is my guide 

I'll find you,
my lost kin I'll find you,
my sista I'll find you,
my bruda I'll find you,
my mama

### Excerpt from Walking Contradiction (#7)

I am what you never thought possible
I have blue eyes and brown skin
I am half sisters with Beyonce
I have a black daddy and a white mommy
I grew up in the hood but I went to private school

### The Product of a One-Night Stand (#10)

I'm the product of a one-night stand
Between a white girl and a black boy

I'm the product of a one-night stand
Who's parents said "It's not you, it's me"

I'm the product of a one-night stand 
Who's grandparents said "We're just not ready"

I'm the product of a one-night stand 
Who's friends say "You're not really black" 

I'm the product of a one-night stand 
Who's world says "You're not really anything" 

But I'm here I'm alive 
I'm the product of a one-night stand

### What Else, Daddy? (#14)

"But, daddy, what are you?"
 
"I'm black, baby"

"but what else"
 
"well...I'm also white"
 
"but what else, daddy?"
 
"I'm also Puerto Rican"
 
"but what else, daddy?"
 
"I'm also...Cuban"
 
"but what else, daddy?"
 
"I'm also...Mexican"
 
"but what else, daddy?"
 

"I'm also...human"

### Mother Daughter Talk (#23)

"Wow, mommy", I said, "a modern day love story"

"But what about your children, of mixed-race?"


"Oh, we'll just raised them to be really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really multicultural."

### Mixed People (#24)


"Mixed people always think they're so ~exotic~"
<br /><br />

No, we just know that we're not fully white 

and we're not fully black 

so we might as well claim a little bit of both 
<br /><br />

We're the in-between 

The not quite 

The always-asking-for-the-receipt 
<br /><br />

We're the 

"What are you?"
 <br /><br />
The 

"Where are you from?"
 <br /><br />
The "
You're so pretty for a black girl"
 <br /><br />

We're the "
Can I touch your hair?"
 
The "Can I say the n-word?"
 
The "Can I call you my token black friend?"
<br /><br />

We're mixed 
and we're beautiful 
and we're not going anywhere

### Excerpt from Just Like We Did (#28)

"But mommy, what about your white friends? Won't they be, like, triggered by our mixed babies? cascading out of your Business and Economics degree?"

### Just Like You (#41)


"But what about your culture? What about your people? ðŸ¤”"
<br /><br />

I'm not sure what you're asking me,
 but I was born in Keokuk, Iowa 
I'm as American as cherry pie
<br /><br />

My daddy was in the Navy 
My mama was a hair dresser 
I have an auntie who's gay 
And an uncle who's in jail 
<br /><br />

So what does that make me?
<br /><br />

A human being, just like you

## Actually Kind of Good

### I'm a Walking Melting Pot (#29)
<br />

"What are you?"

"Where are you from?"

"What's your background?"
<br /><br />

I get asked these questions a lot
As if my skin color is some sort of Rorschach test
And people are just dying to know
What they think they see
<br /><br />

I'm a walking melting pot
A human chai latte
With a shot of espresso
<br /><br />

I'm from the streets of New York
The projects of Chicago
The barrios of Los Angeles
<br /><br />

My background is black
White
Latino
Asian
Native American
<br /><br />

I'm a mix of everything
And I'm proud of it
<br /><br />

But sometimes I just wish people would see me
For who I am
And not what they think I am

### Brown Sugar (#32)

I'm not mixed, I'm just a little brown sugar

But people see me and they're like "
oh, she's mixed"


And I'm like 
"No, I'm not"


But they're like 
"Yes, you are"


And I'm like 
"No, I'm not"


But they're like 
"Yes, you are"


And I'm like 
"Fine, I'm mixed"

### I'm Not Mixed (#17)

I'm not mixed
I'm blended
Like a fine wine

I'm not mixed
I'm flecked
Like a leopard

I'm not mixed
I'm speckled
Like a Dalmatian

I'm not mixed
I'm mottled
Like a Holstein cow

I'm not mixed
I'm variegated
Like a tropical fish

I'm not mixed
I'm marbled
Like a slab of meat

I'm not mixed
I'm motley
Like a jester

I'm not mixed
I'm a patchwork
Like a quilt

### What are you mixed with? (#30)

"What are you mixed with?" they ask

1/2 black, 1/2 white
Just like my mama
Just like my daddy

But what they really want to know is
How much of me is black?

How "authentically" black am I?

Can I use the N-word?

Do I have an afro?

Do I know what it's like to be oppressed?

Let me answer your questions with some questions of my own

What are you mixed with?

1/2 prejudice, 1/2 ignorant
Just like your mama
Just like your daddy

But what I really want to know is
How much of you is human?
