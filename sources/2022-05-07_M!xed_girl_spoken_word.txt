Mixed girl 
Oreo swirl
Kinky-headed girls always came for my silky hair
Sorry KEYSHA 
I don't care

White girls circled around me like culture-vultures
Give us an n-word pass, they said
I ran out when I went to the Travis Scott concert, BECKY 
And you know that

Bi-racial
Bye, Rachel
Rachel from Friends
Friends...I have none

You're so sexy
caramel colored princess 
Stop it 
I'm more than just a head full of curls and juicy brown cakes

I'm a Facebook scammer
A Kony 2012 truther
And you will not define me
