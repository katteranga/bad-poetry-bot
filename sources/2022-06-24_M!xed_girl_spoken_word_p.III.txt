Caramel cheeks
Spread apart
There's still a black hole
Just like yours
My brotha
My sista
Wanna watch as I make it wink

I think that we're all in this together
Kumbaya
Or should I say 
Jambalaya

So what if I would've been in the house
Preparing unseasoned chicken for Mass' wife 
I am still my ancestor's dream

No, my name isn't North West
Or discount Doja Cat
It's MLK's mistress
It's CEO of America
