Mommy was a white walker,
daddy was a...possible nigerian

You mix those two together and you get
a Barack Obama, 
a Halle Berry, 
a whatever-OJ-simpsons-kid's-names-are

Krip walking on the racial divide
I don't want to have to hide 
my identityâ€”
split down the middle

I just wanna dance a little
to a remix of a Drake song
Drake my biracial brother
a message to his son Adonis:
I also came from a secret family
